I am marking this as do not eval so it doesn't redownload 
each time. I can save a working copy of the data and use that
when experimenting,  though still with the ability to run the whole
process. To load the saved dataset I can use the `load()` function.  So depending on what I want to do
I will have one or the other one change to `eval = TRUE`

```{r eval = FALSE}

quakersaints <-  gutenberg_download(c(19605))
save(quakersaints, file="data/quakersaints.rda")
```
```{r eval=FALSE}
load("quakersaints.rda")
```

Previously, we dove straight into tokenizing. But this time let's 
first think about how we could solve some issues. 

Looking specifically at this book, I notice first that there are the 
standard Project Gutenberg texts at the beginning, followed by an 
preface which ends on line 182.

Then from 192 to 260 there is a table of contents with any blank lines. 
Also * in the title indicates "for younger children." 

I would like to separate each of the stories

Using this information, I can subset the data.

```{r}

table_of_contents <- quakersaints[190:260,] 
# Remove blank lines
table_of_contents <- table_of_contents |> filter(text != "")
table_of_contents$text
```

What do you notice about the table of contents? 
I see at least 3 issues.

```{r}
table_of_contents <- table_of_contents |>
                     mutate(younger = substr(text, 1, 1) == "*")
```


```{r}
# Remove numbers (could also use "[0-9]+")
table_of_contents <- table_of_contents |> 
  mutate(text =gsub("[[:digit:]]+", "", text))
# Deal with a special case
table_of_contents <- table_of_contents |>
  mutate(text = sub("_page_ vii", "", text, fixed = TRUE))
# Remove *
table_of_contents <- table_of_contents |> 
  mutate(text =sub("*", "", text, fixed=TRUE))
# Remove extra white space
table_of_contents <- table_of_contents |> 
  mutate(text =trimws(text))
table_of_contents$text
```

Notice that without the last step there is a lot of "white space" around the titles.  I
assume that these are " " values rather than tabs or other white 
space characters.  However if that turns out to be wrong I will use
one of the functions from stringr to get rid of them.

All of the above mutates could be combined into one `mutate()` to be more
efficient. They are separate to illustrate the step by step process.

Also 
 [1] "PREFACE"                                                
 [2] "A TALK ABOUT SAINTS" 
 are different than the other sections so we may want to come back
 and handle them. 


I'm going to cut down the quakersaints data so that it just contains
text after the table of contents and list of illustrations. 

```{r}
quakersaints_trimmed <- quakersaints[290:nrow(quakersaints), ]
```

I'll also add a variable to represent the line number in the trimmed
data. 
As usual there are many ways to do this, I'll use the base method so
you see it , but `mutate(id = row_number())` will also work.

```{r}
quakersaints_trimmed$row_number <- seq.int(nrow(quakersaints_trimmed))
```

Let's find the chapter titles in the text.

```{r}
title_locations <- 
  quakersaints_trimmed |> 
  filter(text %in% table_of_contents$text)
title_locations
```

```{r}
title_locations <- 
  quakersaints_trimmed |> 
  filter(trimws(text) %in% trimws(table_of_contents$text))
title_locations
```
Notice that we lost the younger variable.

Maybe a better way to do this would be to use a join.

```{r}
table_of_contents |> left_join(quakersaints_trimmed, 
                               by = c("gutenberg_id", "text")) ->
  table_of_contents
```




What's the problem now?   
Go back and look at the text. 


We can use this information to say what kind of text each line is. 
The case_when() function is useful when we have complicated if then/else if/ 
else if .../else situations.

```{r}
title_locations <- 
  quakersaints_trimmed |> 
  mutate(text = trimws(text)) |>
  right_join(table_of_contents, by = c("text", "row_number", "gutenberg_id")) |>
  group_by(text) |> 
  mutate(toc_number =  row_number(),  
         text_type = case_when( 
                    text %in% 
                        c("PREFACE", "A TALK ABOUT SAINTS") ~ 
                                          "Front Matter Title",
                    toc_number == 1 ~ "Epigraph Title", 
                    TRUE ~ "Story Title"),
         section_type = case_when(
           text_type == "Epigraph Title" ~ "Epigraph",
           text_type == "Story Title" ~ "Story",
           text_type == "Front Matter Title" ~ "Front Matter"
         )) 
title_locations
```



```{r}

```
So now I know where my stories and epigraphs start and the type of
text.   But 
I need to pull this back into the full data set and 
actually assign all of the lines to their story. 

As always there are a lot of ways to do that, but to keep it simple
we will use the `fill()` function.

Let's start by creating a variable indicating chapter. Then
we will fill that using the title.


```{r}

quakersaints_trimmed |> 
  left_join(title_locations, by = c("row_number", "gutenberg_id")) |>
  # We get text.y and text.x because text is in both data frames,
  # but not in the by vector.
  rename(title = text.y, text = text.x) |>
  mutate(text_type = case_when(is.na(text_type) ~ "Text",
                               TRUE ~ text_type)) |>
  fill(title) |> fill(section_type) |> fill(younger) -> quakersaints_trimmed

```


In my case
I suspect the poetic language might be different so I have indicated for each
line whether it is part of an epigraph or story. 
I might also suspect that the language differs between the stories that are 
considered appropriate for younger children.

I may also want to eliminate the titles from my analyses.

So now I will tokenize.
```{r}
quakersaints_trimmed |> filter(text_type == "Text") |>
  unnest_tokens(word, text, to_lower = TRUE) ->
  quakersaints_long

```

This time I am going to remove the punctuation and numbers and _then_ remove
the stop words.

```{r}

quakersaints_long |>  
  mutate(word = str_extract(word, "[a-z']+")) |>
  anti_join(stop_words) ->
  quakersaints_long

```

Let's look at the top 20 words in the book as a whole. 

```{r}
quakersaints_long |> count(word, sort = TRUE) |> head(20)
```

Looking these over, what should I drop?  How could I have done this 
earlier? 

```{r}
quakersaints_long <- quakersaints_long |> filter (is.na(word) == FALSE)
quakersaints_long |> count(word, sort = TRUE) |> head(20)
quakersaints_long |> group_by(section_type) |> count(word, sort = TRUE) |>
  slice_head(n = 15)
quakersaints_long |> group_by(section_type) |> count(word, sort = TRUE) |>
  mutate(proportion = n / sum(n)) |> select(-n) |>
   pivot_wider(values_from = proportion, names_from = section_type) -> qs_props_section_type
```

```{r}
ggplot(qs_props_section_type, aes(x = Epigraph, y = Story, 
                      )) +
  geom_abline(color = "gray40", lty = 2) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.1, size = 2.5, width = 0.3, height = 0.3) +
  geom_text(aes(label = word), check_overlap = TRUE, vjust = 1.5) +
  scale_x_log10(labels = percent_format()) +
  scale_y_log10(labels = percent_format()) +
  scale_color_gradient(limits = c(0, 0.001), 
                       low = "darkslategray4", high = "gray75") +
  theme(legend.position="none") +
  labs(x = "Epigraph", y = "Story", title = "Word Distributions")
```

```{r}
quakersaints_long |> group_by(younger) |> count(word, sort = TRUE) |>
  mutate(proportion = n / sum(n)) |> select(-n) |>
   pivot_wider(values_from = proportion, names_from = younger) -> qs_props_younger


ggplot(qs_props_younger, aes(x = `TRUE`, y = `FALSE`, 
                      )) +
  geom_abline(color = "gray40", lty = 2) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.1, size = 2.5, width = 0.3, height = 0.3) +
  geom_text(aes(label = word), check_overlap = TRUE, vjust = 1.5) +
  scale_x_log10(labels = percent_format()) +
  scale_y_log10(labels = percent_format()) +
  scale_color_gradient(limits = c(0, 0.001), 
                       low = "darkslategray4", high = "gray75") +
  theme(legend.position="none") +
  labs(x = "Younger", y = "Older", title = "Word Distributions")
```




```{r }
quakersaints_long |> group_by(title) |> count(word, sort = TRUE) |>
  slice_head(n = 10) |> 
   ungroup() |>
  #mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) |>
  
  ggplot(aes( n, word)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_wrap_paginate(~title, scales = "free_y", ncol =3) +
  theme(strip.text = element_text(
    size = 12, color = "dark green"))
  
```
This is really smushed so I want to split it up and use a smaller 
font.
```{r }
quakersaints_long |> group_by(title) |> count(word, sort = TRUE) |>
  slice_head(n = 10) |>
 mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) |>
  ungroup() -> preprocessed




```

```{r}
  
  preprocessed |>
  filter(title %in% table_of_contents$text[c(4, 6, 8, 10, 12 , 14)]) |> 
   ggplot(aes( n, reorder_within(word,n,  title))) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_wrap(~title, scales = "free_y", ncol =2) +
  scale_y_reordered() +
  theme(strip.text = element_text(
    size = 9, color = "dark green"))


  
```


We could do this multiple times by copy and pasting and modifying 
the list of numbers. 

This is not the best option because all that copy and pasting 
introduces the potential for errors. Also if we make changes, we will
do it in one place.

One solution, make a function.  In this case it will be a very
specific function, not like one for use in other situations.

```{r }
# Chapters is a vector of the chapters to be graphed.
make_faceted_title <- function(chapters ){
     preprocessed |>
      filter(title %in% table_of_contents$text[chapters]) |> 
       ggplot(aes( n, reorder_within(word,n,  title))) +
      geom_col() +
      facet_wrap(~title, scales = "free_y", ncol =2) +
      scale_y_reordered() +
      theme(strip.text = element_text(
        size = 9, color = "dark green"))
}
  
```
```{r}
make_faceted_title(chapters = c(16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26))
make_faceted_title(seq(from = 28, to = 38, by = 2))
make_faceted_title(seq(from = 40, to = 52, by = 2))
make_faceted_title(seq(from = 54, to = 64, by = 2))
make_faceted_title(seq(from = 66, to = 68, by = 2))
```
We could also make the function even more general by doing things
like passing in the grouping variable and the name of the preprocessed
data set.  We could even extract the grouping variable from the
preprocessed data set.

```{r}
preprocessed |> group_by(title) |>
group_vars()
```

In class/at home: Clean up the document (get rid of unneeded code, make it flow
more smoothly), consider creating a function to reduce repetitive code, and
edit the text to reflect what you did. 

Also do the same kind of data wrangling and more focused analysis on your data. 

I am going to save my trimmed data, simply to maintain consistency at this
point. 

```{r}
save(quakersaints_trimmed, file = "data/quakersaints_trimmed.rda")
save(quakersaints_long, file = "data/quakersaints_long.rda")

```


```{r}

```
